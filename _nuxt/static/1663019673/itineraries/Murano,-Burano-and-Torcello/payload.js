Two stories are attributed to how the city obtained its name. One is that it was initially founded by the Buriana family, and another is that the first settlers of Burano came from the small island of Buranello, about 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the south.\n\nIn 1291, all the glassmakers in Venice were required to move to Murano. In the following century, exports began, and the island became famous, initially for glass beads and mirrors. Aventurine glass was invented on the island, and for a while Murano was the main producer of glass in Europe. The island later became known for chandeliers. Although decline set in during the eighteenth century, glassmaking is still the island's main industry.\nIn the fifteenth century, the island became popular as a resort for Venetians, and palaces were built, but this later declined. The countryside of the island was known for its orchards and vegetable gardens until the nineteenth century, when more housing was built.",images:[{path:f,pois_images:{imageId:e,poiId:c}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmurano2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:40,poiId:c}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmurano3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:41,poiId:c}}],involve:{itineraryId:b,poiId:c}},{title:"Isola di Torcello",description:"Torcello is a sparsely populated island at the northern end of the Venetian Lagoon, in north-eastern Italy. It was first settled in the year 452 and has been referred to as the parent island from which Venice was populated. It was a town with a cathedral and bishops before St Mark's Basilica was built.\n\nTorcello benefited from and maintained close cultural and trading ties with Constantinople: however, being a rather distant outpost of the Eastern Roman Empire, it could establish de facto autonomy from the eastern capital.\n\nTorcello rapidly grew in importance as a political and trading centre: in the 10th century it had a population often estimated at 10,000-35,000 people, with 20,000 the most commonly cited estimate. However, some recent estimates by archeologists place it at closer to a maximum of 3,000. In pre-Medieval times, Torcello was a much more powerful trading center than Venice.",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorcello1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:68,poiId:d}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorcello2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:69,poiId:d}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorcello3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:70,poiId:d}}],involve:{itineraryId:b,poiId:d}},{title:"Museo Storico Navale",description:"The Museo Storico Navale is a naval history museum located in the Castello district of Venice, near the Venetian Arsenal.\n\nThe museum was established by the Regia Marina (the Italian Royal Navy) in 1919.
