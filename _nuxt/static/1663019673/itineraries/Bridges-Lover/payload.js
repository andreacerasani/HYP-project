It is similar to the wooden bridge it succeeded. Two ramps lead up to a central portico. On either side of the portico, the covered ramps carry rows of shops. The engineering of the bridge was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin.

The enclosed bridge is made of white limestone, has windows with stone bars, passes over the Rio di Palazzo, and connects the New Prison (Prigioni Nuove) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace. It was designed by Antonio Contino, whose uncle Antonio da Ponte designed the Rialto Bridge, and it was built in 1600.\n\nThe view from the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment. The bridge's English name was bequeathed by Lord Byron in the 19th century as a translation from the Italian \"Ponte dei sospiri\", from the suggestion that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the window before being taken down to their cells.\n\nThe Bridge of Sighs features heavily in the plot of the 1979 film A Little Romance. One of the characters tells of a tradition that if a couple kiss in a gondola beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever.",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_sospiri1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:59,poiId:e}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_sospiri2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:60,poiId:e}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_sospiri3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:61,poiId:e}}],involve:{itineraryId:a,poiId:e}}]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(3,4,5,18,19,56,"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_rialto1.jpg")));
