It is one of the most famous and renowned landmarks in the history of Italian theatre and in the history of opera as a whole.\n\nIts name reflects its role in permitting an opera company to \"rise from the ashes\" despite losing the use of three theatres to fire, the first in 1774 after the city's leading house was destroyed and rebuilt but not opened until 1792, the second fire came in 1836, but rebuilding was completed within a year. However, the third fire was the result of arson. It destroyed the house in 1996 leaving only the exterior walls, but it was rebuilt and re-opened in November 2004. In order to celebrate this event the tradition of the Venice New Year's Concert started.\n\nLa Fenice immediately made its mark as one of the leading opera houses, noted in Italy and Europe both for the high artistic quality of its work and the splendour of its building. But, almost as if the name were the bearer of bad omens, on the night of 13 December 1836 the opera house was devastated by a first fire caused by a recently installed Austrian heater. By the evening of 26 December of the same year, the new opera house, reborn in the new artistic style of the age, was opened to the public.",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fteatro_fenice1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:65,poiId:e}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fteatro_fenice2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:66,poiId:e}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fteatro_fenice3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:67,poiId:e}}],involve:{itineraryId:a,poiId:e}},{title:"Ca' Rezzonico",description:"Ca' Rezzonico is a palazzo on the Grand Canal in the Dorsoduro sestiere of Venice, Italy.

Turning his attention to the interior, Massari broke with Venetian custom and put the major ceremonial room at the back of the building, not overlooking the canal. He doubled the height of the ceiling in this room and eliminated walls to create a more dramatic space.\n\nThe palace was the site of further celebrations in 1759, when Aurelio Rezzonico was elected Procurator of San Marco, and in 1762, when Ludovico Rezzonico was elected to the same position.
