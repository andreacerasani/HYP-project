What constitutes life, and what differentiates plant and animal, human and non-human? What are our responsibilities towards the planet, other people, and other life forms? And what would life look like without us?",date:"2023-04-23",ticket:25.5,contactId:29,poiId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fevents\u002Fthemilkofdreams1.jpg",events_images:{imageId:97,eventId:b}},{path:"images\u002Fevents\u002Fthemilkofdreams2.jpg",events_images:{imageId:98,eventId:b}},{path:"images\u002Fevents\u002Fthemilkofdreams3.jpg",events_images:{imageId:99,eventId:b}}],poi:{title:"La Biennale",address:"Forte Marghera",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbiennale1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:15,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbiennale2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:16,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbiennale3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:a,poiId:a}}]},contact:{landline_phone:"041 943430",mobile_phone:"3319969674",email:"labiennale.events@gmail.com"}}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(17,9)));
