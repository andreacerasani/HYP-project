For this reason soon the Burano Carnival (\"\"El Carneval de Buran\"\") became an unmissable event for Buranelli, Venetians, people coming from all over the Veneto and of course tourists.","2023-02-22","images\u002Fevents\u002Fcarnevaleburano1.jpg",77,"images\u002Fevents\u002Fcarnevaleburano2.jpg",78,"images\u002Fevents\u002Fcarnevaleburano3.jpg",79,"images\u002Fevents\u002Fcarnevaleburano4.jpg",80,"\u002Fevents\u002FBurano-Carnival","Svolo del Leon","The so called Svolo del Leon puts symbolically the word end to the Carnival events.\n\nIt is an enormous flag of San Marco depicting the famous winged lion that will be taken up with a pulley system, from the square packed with people, where formerly took place the coronation of the Maria winner of Carnival, up to San Marco bell tower.\nIn the background the musicians of the Fenice BrassOpera will play the anthem of San Marco.\n\nThis closing event is a ritual of great beauty, a tribute to the city's landmark, the winged lion, so dear to Venetians.","2023-02-28","images\u002Fevents\u002Fsvololeon1.jpg",94,"images\u002Fevents\u002Fsvololeon2.jpg",95,"images\u002Fevents\u002Fsvololeon3.jpg",96,"\u002Fevents\u002FSvolo-del-Leon")));
