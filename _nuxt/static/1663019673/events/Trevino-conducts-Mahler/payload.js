It is sometimes referred to by the title Song of the Night (German: Lied der Nacht), which Mahler never knew.\n\nThe Symphony no. 7 is among the most difficult and complex of Mahler's nine symphonies, according to the composer himself, who worked on it in a fit of rage in almost total isolation. The Symphony was less successful with the public, compared to the remarkable interest in the music scene.\n\nRobert Trevino (born 1984) is an American conductor.
