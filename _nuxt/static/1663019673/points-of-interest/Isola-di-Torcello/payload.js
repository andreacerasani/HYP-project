It was first settled in the year 452 and has been referred to as the parent island from which Venice was populated. It was a town with a cathedral and bishops before St Mark's Basilica was built.\n\nTorcello benefited from and maintained close cultural and trading ties with Constantinople: however, being a rather distant outpost of the Eastern Roman Empire, it could establish de facto autonomy from the eastern capital.\n\nTorcello rapidly grew in importance as a political and trading centre: in the 10th century it had a population often estimated at 10,000-35,000 people, with 20,000 the most commonly cited estimate. However, some recent estimates by archeologists place it at closer to a maximum of 3,000. In pre-Medieval times, Torcello was a much more powerful trading center than Venice.",opening_hours:b,closing_hours:b,ticket:0,address:"Torcello, Venezia",contactId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorcello1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:68,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorcello2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:69,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorcello3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:70,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 835498",mobile_phone:"3350589570",email:"isoladitorcello.venezia@turismo.it"},itineraries:[{title:"Murano, Burano and Torcello",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmurano1.jpg"}],description:"Visit Torcello, Murano, and Burano three islands in the Venetian Lagoon on this tour from Venice by motorboat.\n\nWith a guide, watch glass being blown at a Murano glass factory, see historical cathedrals on Torcello, and admire exquisite handmade lace on Burano.
