It is a particularly notable example of the 18th century Venetian baroque and rococo architecture and interior decoration, and displays paintings by the leading Venetian painters of the period, including Francesco Guardi and Giambattista Tiepolo. \nCa' Rezzonico stands on the right bank of the canal, at the point where it is joined by the Rio di San Barnaba.\n\nThe facade was finished between 1750 and 1752. Turning his attention to the interior, Massari broke with Venetian custom and put the major ceremonial room at the back of the building, not overlooking the canal. He doubled the height of the ceiling in this room and eliminated walls to create a more dramatic space.\n\nThe palace was the site of further celebrations in 1759, when Aurelio Rezzonico was elected Procurator of San Marco, and in 1762, when Ludovico Rezzonico was elected to the same position. For three nights, the facades and interiors of the palace were lit with torches and candles in celebration.",opening_hours:"10:00:00",closing_hours:"18:00:00",ticket:10,address:"Dorsoduro, 3136, 30123 Venezia VE",contactId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fca_rezzonico1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:21,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fca_rezzonico2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:22,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fca_rezzonico3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:23,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 531850",mobile_phone:"3325708204",email:"carezzonico.venezia@turismo.it "},itineraries:[{title:"The Art Of Venice",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fgallerie_accademia1.jpg"}],description:"The itinerary allows you to learn about the greatest artists who worked in the city of Venice, let us guide you on a journey through art and culture.\n\nStarting from the Gallerie dell'Accademia to the Biennale you will discover works and stories that will remain in your heart forever.",linkPath:"\u002Fitineraries\u002FThe-Art-Of-Venice"}]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(13)));
