The name Rialto derives from the Italian rivo alto = the high bank . It was one of the first places in the lagoon to be settled. From the very beginning, trade and traffic have been concentrated at the Rialto.\n\nOriginally the Venice market was held on Saturdays in the large square of Olivolo in Castello. Especially in the early days it was known for having no taxes and other public charges, and in this way it was able to compete with the markets of Pavia and Campalto , then among the most important in Italy. When the government settled here in the 9th century, the Rialto became the driving force behind the development of commerce. The construction of a fish and vegetable market was the visible confirmation of the successful efforts.",opening_hours:b,closing_hours:b,ticket:0,address:"Sestiere San Polo 122, 30125 Venezia VE",contactId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmercato_rialto1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:36,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmercato_rialto2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:37,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmercato_rialto3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:38,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 262863",mobile_phone:"3398751519",email:"mercatidirialto.venezia@turismo.it"},itineraries:[]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(20,"00:00:00")));
