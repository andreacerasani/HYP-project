Connecting the sestieri (districts) of San Marco and San Polo, it has been rebuilt several times since its first construction as a pontoon bridge in 1173, and is now a significant tourist attraction in the city.\n\nThe development and importance of the Rialto market on the eastern bank increased traffic on the floating bridge.\n\nThe present stone bridge, a single span designed by Antonio da Ponte, began to be constructed in 1588 and was completed in 1591. It is similar to the wooden bridge it succeeded. Two ramps lead up to a central portico. On either side of the portico, the covered ramps carry rows of shops. The engineering of the bridge was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin. The bridge has defied its critics to become one of the architectural icons, and top tourist attractions, in Venice.",opening_hours:b,closing_hours:b,ticket:0,address:"Ponte di Rialto, Venezia VE",contactId:a,images:[{path:c,pois_images:{imageId:56,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_rialto2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:57,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_rialto3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:58,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 930963",mobile_phone:"3326019245",email:"pontedirialto.venezia@turismo.it "},itineraries:[{title:"Bridges Lover",images:[{path:c}],description:"Venice, the floating city, one cannot visit Venice without getting lost among its bridges and canals, and discovering all the glimpses that this city can offer.\n\nAnd that is exactly what this itinerary seeks to show you by taking you around the most famous and important bridges and canals that connect the city",linkPath:"\u002Fitineraries\u002FBridges-Lover"}]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(5,"00:00:00","images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_rialto1.jpg")));
