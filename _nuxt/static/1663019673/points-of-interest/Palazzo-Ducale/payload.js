The palace was the residence of the Doge of Venice, the supreme authority of the former Republic. It was built in 1340 and extended and modified in the following centuries. It became a museum in 1923 and is one of the 11 museums run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia.\n\nThe palace was built out of fortresses, one fa√ßade to the Piazzetta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. Although only few traces remain of that palace, some Byzantine-Venetian architecture characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in Istrian stone and some herring-bone pattern brick paving.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor.",opening_hours:"09:00:00",closing_hours:"19:00:00",ticket:25,address:"Doge's palace, 30124 Venezia VE",contactId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fpalazzo_ducale1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:46,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fpalazzo_ducale2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:47,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fpalazzo_ducale3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:48,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 620742",mobile_phone:"3378984976",email:"palazzoducale.venezia@turismo.it"},itineraries:[{title:"Must Sees of Venice",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbasilica_san_marco1.jpg"}],description:"One cannot pass through Venice without visiting these places.\n\nThis itinerary will take you to the city's landmarks, those who made Venice an unforgettable place, from St. Mark's Basilica to the Doge's Palace.
