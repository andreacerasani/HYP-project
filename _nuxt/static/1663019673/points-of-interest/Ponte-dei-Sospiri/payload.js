The enclosed bridge is made of white limestone, has windows with stone bars, passes over the Rio di Palazzo, and connects the New Prison (Prigioni Nuove) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace. It was designed by Antonio Contino, whose uncle Antonio da Ponte designed the Rialto Bridge, and it was built in 1600.\n\nThe view from the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment. The bridge's English name was bequeathed by Lord Byron in the 19th century as a translation from the Italian \"Ponte dei sospiri\", from the suggestion that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the window before being taken down to their cells.\n\nThe Bridge of Sighs features heavily in the plot of the 1979 film A Little Romance. One of the characters tells of a tradition that if a couple kiss in a gondola beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever.",opening_hours:b,closing_hours:b,ticket:0,address:"Ponte dei Sospiri, Piazza San Marco, Venezia, VE",contactId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_sospiri1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:59,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_sospiri2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:60,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_sospiri3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:61,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 910577",mobile_phone:"3369135312",email:"ilpontedeisospiri.venezia@turismo.it"},itineraries:[{title:"Bridges Lover",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fponte_rialto1.jpg"}],description:"Venice, the floating city, one cannot visit Venice without getting lost among its bridges and canals, and discovering all the glimpses that this city can offer.\n\nAnd that is exactly what this itinerary seeks to show you by taking you around the most famous and important bridges and canals that connect the city",linkPath:"\u002Fitineraries\u002FBridges-Lover"}]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(19,"00:00:00")));
