It adjoins the eastern end of the Procuratie Vecchie. Both the tower and the clock date from the last decade of the 15th century, though the mechanism of the clock has subsequently been much altered. It was placed where the clock would be visible from the waters of the lagoon and give notice to everyone of the wealth and glory of Venice.\n\nOn a terrace at the top of the tower are two great bronze figures, hinged at the waist, which strike the hours on a bell. One is old and the other young, to show the passing of time and, although said to represent shepherds (they are wearing sheepskins) or giants (they are huge figures of great mass, necessary so that their form can be recognized at a distance) they are known as \"the Moors\" because of the dark patina acquired by the bronze. The bell is also original and is signed by Simeone Campanato, who cast it at the Arsenal in 1497.",opening_hours:"11:00:00",closing_hours:"14:00:00",ticket:12,address:null,contactId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorre_orologio1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:71,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorre_orologio2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:72,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Ftorre_orologio3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:73,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 473471",mobile_phone:"3330021404",email:"torredellorologio.venezia@turismo.it "},itineraries:[]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(6)));
