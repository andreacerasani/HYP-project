One of the older palaces in the city, its name means \"golden house\" due to the gilt and polychrome external decorations which once adorned its walls. Since 1927, it has been used as a museum, as the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti.\n\nIt has long been regarded as the best surviving palazzo in Venetian Gothic architecture, retaining all the most characteristic features, despite some losses. On the facade, the loggia-like window group of closely spaced small columns, with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above, uses the formula from the Doge's Palace that had become iconic. There are also the byzantine-inspired decoration along the roofline, and patterning in fancy coloured stone to the flat wall surfaces. The smaller windows show a variety of forms with an ogee arch, capped with a relief ornament, and the edges and zone boundaries are marked with ropework reliefs.",opening_hours:"08:15:00",closing_hours:"18:00:00",ticket:11,address:"Calle Ca' d'Oro, 3934, 30121 Venezia VE",contactId:a,images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fca_oro1.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:18,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fca_oro2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:19,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fca_oro3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:20,poiId:a}}],events:[{title:"Donatello to Alessandra Vittoria",description:"The Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro hosts From Donatello to Alessandro Vittoria, 1450 - 1600.\n\nThe show, installed at the museum's piano nobile, will focus on the dialogue between several works of masters operating in Venice and in the territories of the Republic between the 15th  and 17th centuries, such as Donatello, Antonio Rizzo, Pietro, Tullio and Antonio Lombardo and also Jacopo Sansovino and Alessandro Vittoria, displaying, in addition to pieces already known to the general public, some sculptures never seen in museum contexts.\n\nThe exhibition aims to give back to the visitors the interpretative variety of the sculptura-l technique, underlining its value and the richness of aesthetic declinations and materials within a historical-artistic context that too often prefers painting in the artistic discourse on Venice.",date:"2023-04-22",images:[{path:"images\u002Fevents\u002Fdonatelloalessandravittoria3.jpg",events_images:{imageId:83,eventId:b}},{path:"images\u002Fevents\u002Fdonatelloalessandravittoria1.jpg",events_images:{imageId:81,eventId:b}},{path:"images\u002Fevents\u002Fdonatelloalessandravittoria2.jpg",events_images:{imageId:82,eventId:b}}],linkPath:"\u002Fevents\u002FDonatello-to-Alessandra-Vittoria"}],contact:{landline_phone:"041 615928",mobile_phone:"3325066763",email:"cadoro.venezia@turismo.it "},itineraries:[{title:"Must Sees of Venice",images:[{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbasilica_san_marco1.jpg"}],description:"One cannot pass through Venice without visiting these places.\n\nThis itinerary will take you to the city's landmarks, those who made Venice an unforgettable place, from St. Mark's Basilica to the Doge's Palace.
