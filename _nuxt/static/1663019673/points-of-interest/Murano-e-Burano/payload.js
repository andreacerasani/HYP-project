Two stories are attributed to how the city obtained its name. One is that it was initially founded by the Buriana family, and another is that the first settlers of Burano came from the small island of Buranello, about 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the south.\n\nIn 1291, all the glassmakers in Venice were required to move to Murano. In the following century, exports began, and the island became famous, initially for glass beads and mirrors. Aventurine glass was invented on the island, and for a while Murano was the main producer of glass in Europe. The island later became known for chandeliers. Although decline set in during the eighteenth century, glassmaking is still the island's main industry.\nIn the fifteenth century, the island became popular as a resort for Venetians, and palaces were built, but this later declined. The countryside of the island was known for its orchards and vegetable gardens until the nineteenth century, when more housing was built.",opening_hours:c,closing_hours:c,ticket:0,address:"Murano, Venezia",contactId:a,images:[{path:d,pois_images:{imageId:39,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmurano2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:40,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fmurano3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:41,poiId:a}}],events:[{title:"Burano Carnival",description:"The Venice Carnival is the most internationally known festival celebrated in Venice, and is also one of the oldest.\n\nThe origin of this celebraton of fashination, elegance, colours, madness and mistery goes back to the year 1296, when the Serenissima Republic declared the Shrove Tuesday (mardi gras) a city holiday.\n\nThe celebrations for the Carnival were abolished after nearly 500 years by Napoleon in 1797 and were reinstated only when the city was submitted to Austria.During the years 1970s-1980s the Carnival celebrations experienced a period of decline: in Venice no more parties were organized, and the almost 900 years tradition was left at the mercy of disappearance.\n\nIt was only thanks to Burano that the festival survived.
