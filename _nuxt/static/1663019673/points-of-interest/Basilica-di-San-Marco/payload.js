To convey the republic's wealth and power, the original brick fa√ßades and interior walls were embellished over time with precious stones and rare marbles, primarily in the thirteenth century. Many of the columns, reliefs, and sculptures were spoils stripped from the churches, palaces, and public monuments of Constantinople as a result of the Venetian participation in the Fourth Crusade.\n\nThe interior of the domes, the vaults, and the upper walls were slowly covered with gold-ground mosaics depicting saints, prophets, and biblical scenes. Many of these mosaics were later retouched or remade as artistic tastes changed and damaged mosaics had to be replaced, such that the mosaics represent eight hundred years of artistic styles.",opening_hours:"09:30:00",closing_hours:"17:00:00",ticket:3.5,address:"P.za San Marco, 328, 30100 Venezia VE",contactId:a,images:[{path:b,pois_images:{imageId:11,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbasilica_san_marco2.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:12,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbasilica_san_marco3.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:13,poiId:a}},{path:"images\u002Fpois\u002Fbasilica_san_marco4.jpg",pois_images:{imageId:14,poiId:a}}],events:[],contact:{landline_phone:"041 156462",mobile_phone:"3345666212",email:"basilicadisanmarco.venezia@turismo.it"},itineraries:[{title:"Must Sees of Venice",images:[{path:b}],description:"One cannot pass through Venice without visiting these places.\n\nThis itinerary will take you to the city's landmarks, those who made Venice an unforgettable place, from St. Mark's Basilica to the Doge's Palace.
