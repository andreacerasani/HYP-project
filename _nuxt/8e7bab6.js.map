The Lombard hordes, whose incursions into northern Italy began in AD 568, drove great numbers of mainlanders onto the islands of the lagoon, previously the homes of itinerant fishermen and salt workers. The isolated communities, literally islands of Veneto-Byzantine civilization, became part of the exarchate of Ravenna when it was created in 584. When the mainland Byzantine city of Oderzo fell to the Lombards in 641, political authority was shifted to one of the islands in the Venetian lagoon.',\r\n\r\n        'The first elected doge, or duke, was Orso, chosen in an anti-Byzantine military declaration in 727, but he was succeeded by Byzantine officials until about 751, when the exarchate of Ravenna came to an end. There followed decades of internal political strife among various settlements vying for supremacy and between pro- and anti-Byzantine factions; also involved were attempts by church authorities to acquire temporal influence. Finally the doge Obelerio and his brother Beato formed an alliance with the Franks of Italy and placed Venice under the authority of the Italian king Pippin (died 810) in order to free themselves from Byzantine control.',\r\n        \r\n        'Pro-Byzantine reaction to this event under the doges of the Parteciaco family led to the transfer of the seat of government to the Rialto group of islands, by then the centre for exiles in the factional fighting. Though a Franco-Byzantine treaty of 814 guaranteed to Venice political and juridical independence from the rule of the Western Empire, it did not confirm any effective dependence on the Byzantine Empire, and by 840–841 the doge was negotiating international agreements in his own name. The unusual legal and political position of the small independent duchy, situated in territorial isolation between two great empires, contributed greatly to its function as a trading intermediary.',\r\n        \r\n        'A long succession of serious disputes between leading families concerning the office of doge did not halt the rapid development of trade. Increase in private wealth led to the gradual achievement of internal stability by creating a broader ruling class that was capable of putting a limit to the power of the doge. Gradually a national consciousness developed. Beginning in the late 9th century, the doges were chosen by popular election, though the right was frequently abused during times of civil strife.

The executive organ was the ducal curia, and the legislative assembly was summoned to approve the doge’s acts.

The Venetians retained control of many of the Greek islands, however, and gradually found their way back to partial favour in Byzantium through a series of treaties. But when the last of the Crusader strongholds in Syria fell to the Muslims in 1291, Venetian merchants who had been dispossessed moved north to dispute the Black Sea trade with the Genoese.

The Council of 40 (Quarantia; first mentioned in 1223) received powers of jurisdiction, and the Consiglio dei Rogati (60 members; founded mid-13th century), invested with the control of economic affairs, in time assumed all legislative functions and the honorific title of Senate.',\r\n\r\n          'In the 11th and 12th centuries the Michiel and Falier families had tried in vain to perpetuate their ducal power, and restrictive electoral systems were instituted to prevent the formation of committed family factions.

Henceforward anyone claiming personal power had to act outside the patrician order and rely on the people; and the people were linked so closely to the patricians by their economic needs that sufficient support was always lacking. Thus, the conspiracy of Marin Bocconio failed (1299), as did those of Bajamonte Tiepolo and the Querini brothers (1310) and later of Marin Falier (1354). The special character of Venetian society created a governing class very different from that of the other Italian communes or of the continental states.

In the alternation of victories and defeats, both sides exhausted their energies and resources. At last a second anti-Venetian coalition brought the war almost into Venice itself; at Pula (Pola) and at Chioggia, Venice first was defeated and then won the war (1380–81).

For a time, Venetian territorial rule went no further than the Mincio and Livenza rivers, but beyond the Livenza lay the politically and economically important principality of the patriarch of Aquileia, through which passed the main routes to Germany and to Istria.

By 1508 these powers, together with the pope, the Hungarians, the Savoyards, and the Ferrarese, united to form the League of Cambrai against the Venetians, who were defeated at the Battle of Agnadello. Venice was saved from the worst results of this event by internal discord within the League of Cambrai, but Venetian territories on the mainland were diminished. At the same time, the republic was experiencing an economic crisis. Not only was the Eastern market lost, but the discovery of new lands in the West and new trade routes to the East released Europe from dependence on Venetian merchants. Venice ceased to be a Mediterranean power, and, as a European power, it lacked the advantage that the Atlantic countries had of direct access to the New World.',\r\n\r\n          'Venetian policy in the 16th century was dictated by the need to keep intact its political, economic, and territorial heritage against the advance of the Turks on the one side and the pressure of the great western European powers on the other. This need supplied the reason for Venice’s intervention in the Italian crisis of the emperor Charles V; for its struggle against the Turks, from the defeat of Préveza in 1538 to the victory of Lepanto and the loss of Cyprus in 1571; and for its tenacious resistance to pressure from the pope. So Venice declined into economic stagnation, embittered by a constitutional conflict between the Consiglio dei Rogati and the Council of Ten for control of the public finances. Venetian peace and neutrality meant defending the immediate interests of the nation but ceasing to take part in problems in which it was not directly concerned. Thus, the spirit of political and religious conservatism grew increasingly tenacious in Venice.',\r\n          \r\n          'A political crisis was created by the papal interdict of Venice in 1606, concerned not with heresy or reform but with temporal prerogatives of the papacy.

This blow to morale was mitigated, however, by the preservation of Dalmatia, and the government, after allying itself with Austria, attempted to reestablish itself in the eastern Mediterranean by liberating the Morea (Peloponnese) from the Turks. There the brilliant campaign of Francesco Morosini in 1684–88 assured Venice of this new Greek territory, which was finally handed over in 1699. But the conquest proved profitless and became an expensive burden, and in 1718 the Morea was returned to the Turks.

It lost even more in 1932 when a parallel road was built to give access to motor vehicles.

The 1968 film festival was also the scene of large protests. Later the Socialists ran the city, but their plans for massive development, including a world’s fair proposed in the mid-1980s, were blocked by protests over possible damage to the city. Socialist rule was swept away by corruption scandals in the 1990s, allowing the victory of a reformist intellectual mayor, Massimo Cacciari, who attempted to modernize Venice while protecting its immense heritage. Cacciari’s seven years in power saw many changes in the administration of the city, but he was unable to secure action on such basic structural problems as population loss and high water.',\r\n\r\n          'The 1990s also saw Venice become a symbol of the regionalist politics of the Northern Leagues (Lega Nord), a collection of parties that advocated a federal structure for Italy and greater autonomy in particular for the country’s prosperous northern regions. Northern regionalism began in Veneto in the early 1980s, and it was in Venice in 1996 that Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, read a so-called declaration of independence of a separate “Padanian” state.

In the second half of the 20th century, the deterioration of ancient buildings and art treasures, which had long been associated with natural phenomena such as flooding and subsidence, was intensified by an atmosphere laden with sulfuric acid, much of it generated by industrial and domestic smoke. As in other cities in which monuments and works of art stand exposed, air pollution corroded and defaced many priceless examples of stonework from the Venetian past. Severely damaging storms and floods in November 1966 stimulated increased efforts to rescue the historic city from environmental destruction, yet flood-control projects (big and small) have been blocked through a combination of inefficiency, corruption, and overprotection of Venice through special laws and ecological politics. Venice has always been a city of production, from the invention of mass boat and ship construction in the Arsenal to the industrialization of Port Marghera.
