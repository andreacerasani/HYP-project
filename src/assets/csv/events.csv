4;Trevino conducts Mahler;The Symphony No. 7 by Gustav Mahler was written in 1904-05, with repeated revisions to the scoring. It is sometimes referred to by the title Song of the Night (German: Lied der Nacht), which Mahler never knew.\n\nThe Symphony no. 7 is among the most difficult and complex of Mahler's nine symphonies, according to the composer himself, who worked on it in a fit of rage in almost total isolation. The Symphony was less successful with the public, compared to the remarkable interest in the music scene.\n\nRobert Trevino (born 1984) is an American conductor. He is currently music director of the Basque National Orchestra in Spain, principal guest conductor of the Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI, and artistic advisor of the Malmo Symphony Orchestra in Sweden.;27/05/2023;23;24;7
5;Donatello to Alessandra Vittoria;The Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro hosts From Donatello to Alessandro Vittoria, 1450 - 1600.\n\nThe show, installed at the museum's piano nobile, will focus on the dialogue between several works of masters operating in Venice and in the territories of the Republic between the 15th  and 17th centuries, such as Donatello, Antonio Rizzo, Pietro, Tullio and Antonio Lombardo and also Jacopo Sansovino and Alessandro Vittoria, displaying, in addition to pieces already known to the general public, some sculptures never seen in museum contexts.\n\nThe exhibition aims to give back to the visitors the interpretative variety of the sculptura-l technique, underlining its value and the richness of aesthetic declinations and materials within a historical-artistic context that too often prefers painting in the artistic discourse on Venice.;22/04/2023;12;25;8
6;Burano Carnival;The Venice Carnival is the most internationally known festival celebrated in Venice, and is also one of the oldest.\n\nThe origin of this celebraton of fashination, elegance, colours, madness and mistery goes back to the year 1296, when the Serenissima Republic declared the Shrove Tuesday (mardi gras) a city holiday.\n\nThe celebrations for the Carnival were abolished after nearly 500 years by Napoleon in 1797 and were reinstated only when the city was submitted to Austria.During the years 1970s-1980s the Carnival celebrations experienced a period of decline: in Venice no more parties were organized, and the almost 900 years tradition was left at the mercy of disappearance.\n\nIt was only thanks to Burano that the festival survived. For this reason soon the Burano Carnival (""El Carneval de Buran"") became an unmissable event for Buranelli, Venetians, people coming from all over the Veneto and of course tourists.;22/02/2023;0;26;9

9;The Milk Of Dreams;The Milk of Dreams takes its title from a book by Leonora Carrington (1917-2011) in which the Surrealist artist describes a magical world where life is constantly re-envisioned through the prism of the imagination.\n\nIt is a world where everyone can change, be transformed, become something or someone else, a world set free, brimming with possibilities, but it is also the allegory of a century that imposed intolerable pressure on the very definition of the self, forcing Carrington into a life of exile: locked up in mental hospitals, an eternal object of fascination and desire, yet also a figure of startling power and mystery, always fleeing the strictures of a fixed, coherent identity.\n\nThis exhibition is grounded in many conversations with artists held in the last few years.\nHow is the definition of the human changing? What constitutes life, and what differentiates plant and animal, human and non-human? What are our responsibilities towards the planet, other people, and other life forms? And what would life look like without us?;23/04/2023;25.5;29;17

The program is divided into different thematic areas (lecture, literature, history, music, theater, cinema, food and wine, festivals) that will allow different aspects of French culture to be explored from time to time.\n\nThe review, which has the patronage of the City of Venice, was born from the collaboration with Alliance Française, Institut Français, Ca Foscari University and the excellences of our territory.;02/04/2023;0;30;15
